# React Introduction Lab

Edit multiple JavaScript files in this lab as you get the hang of creating and using components.

---

## Lab Setup

### Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your command line. Then, run the following command:

      ```
   npm install
   ```

   This will install the libraries needed to run the tests.

1. Open up the repository in VSCode. Follow the instructions below to complete the Lab.

### Tests

To run the tests, you can run the following command from the command line. You will need to be in the root directory of your local directory.

```
npm test
```

This will open the Cypress testing window, where you can click to run an individual suite of tests or all of the tests at once.

#### Testing Tips

Keep the following in mind for this lab as you run the tests.

1. The application mockups below are a design reference for if you have time. The main purpose of this lab is to connect all the components and get the tests to pass.

1. While running your tests, you must have a server up and running in another terminal. This means you will have _both_ a terminal window running the actual React application _and_ a terminal window running the tests.

1. When creating a component, make sure to create and import it with the same name as the file name. For example, the component created and exported inside of the `Post.js` file should be `Post`. The tests look for these specific names.

1. While the `cypress-watch-and-reload` package has been installed in this project, sometimes the React application will take longer to reload than the tests. If you feel as though a test should be passing that isn't, try pressing the re-run button in the Cypress tests before asking for help.

## Instructions

Connect all of the components inside of the `Components/` directory so that each component shows up on the page.

Your application should have the following component structure:

![components tree](./component_tree.png)

The component tree above can also be shown as a list:

![components list](./components.png)

If you have time, build out the page to be more detailed, like the following mockup image.

![ProfilePage](./ProfilePage.png)
